**defguard_wireguard_rs** is a multi-platform Rust library providing a unified high-level API for managing WireGuard interfaces using native OS kernel and userspace WireGuard protocol implementations.
It can be used to create your own [WireGuard:tm:](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN servers or clients for secure and private networking.

It was developed as part of [defguard](https://github.com/defguard/defguard) security platform and used in the [gateway/server](https://github.com/defguard/gateway) as well as [desktop client](https://github.com/defguard/client).

## Supported platforms

* **Native OS Kernel**: Linux, FreeBSD (and pfSense/OPNSense), Windows
* Userspace using [wireguard-go](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go) - Linux, **macOS**, FreeBSD

### Unique features

* **Peer routing** - see [WGApi](https://docs.rs/defguard_wireguard_rs/latest/defguard_wireguard_rs/struct.WGApi.html) docs.
* Configuring **DNS resolver** - see [WGApi](https://docs.rs/defguard_wireguard_rs/latest/defguard_wireguard_rs/struct.WGApi.html) docs.
  * On FreeBSD network interfaces are managed using **ioctl**.
  * On Linux, handle network routing using **netlink**.
  * **fwmark** handling

### Windows support
Please note that [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) needs to be installed on Windows with commands `wg` and `wireguard` available to be called from the command line.

### Note on `wireguard-go`
If you intend to use the userspace WireGuard implementation you should note that currently the library assumes 
that the `wireguard-go` binary will be available at runtime. There are some sanity checks when instantiating the API, 
but installing it is outside the scope of this project.

## Examples
